## Fungible Token ERC20
a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.) has been created in the project. KaseiCoin is a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. 

The Kaesi Crowdsale allows the coin to the offered as a crowdsale that allows people to convert their money to KaseiCoin.

This token was minted by using a Crowdsale contract from OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KTX, or KaseiCoin tokens. This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.
